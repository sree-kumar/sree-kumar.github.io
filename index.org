#+TITLE: My Orgmode GitHub Experiments

* Preamble
This is my index file.  I am learning posting my org-mode
files to GitHub.  There are plenty of tutorials and code
bases available in GitHub.  But, I found everything
confusing for me as I am newbie.

I decided to go step by step through my journey. I will
maintain each task as an org file which are listed below.

This file will not be changed for the purpose of remembering
how I started.  Only tasks will be added to this file.  All
the changes happening will be documented in *Tasks*.
